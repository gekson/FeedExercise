Assignment Introduction
Your have been tasked with creating a basic News Feed Reader System in Java.
* A Feed contains FeedItems
* Feed Items contain the title of the feed item and the content of the feed item. You have been
provided this class, so you do not have to write it.
A sample main method has been provided to test the code you write. A FeedItem class has been
provided so you don’t have to implement that. Each of the interfaces given should be implemented by
you according to the instructions in this brief.
You may not alter the interfaces in any way, with the only exception of the import for your
custom packages. You must structure your code as described in this brief. All the files you have
been given should remain in the given package. All the files you implement should be placed in a
package called algorithmsandconstructs.s123456 where 123456 is replaced by your student number.
Provided files:
* FeedFactoryInterface.java – lists the method signatures of a class whose function is create
Feeds.
* FeedInterface.java – lists the method signatures of a class whose function is to manage the
Feed. Remember, a Feed contains FeedItems.
* FeedItem.java – This class is the blueprint for the FeedItem.
* FeedReader.java - a main method that tries your code out.
* test.rss - a text based file to read the details of one feed. It has the title and content for 3
FeedItems.

Specific Requirements
* You are required to implement two classes:
* Feed.java - implements FeedInterface.java
* FeedFactory.java - implements FeedFactoryInterface.java
* You must implement all methods defined in the relevant interfaces, you may define
additional helper methods if it makes your coding easier but is not required.
* You must not change any of the method signatures defined in the interfaces, or the
structure of the rss file.
* You must keep the structure of the Eclipse project provided.
* You must put the files you write in a package called algorithmsandconstructs.s123456
where 123456 represent your student number.
* You must submit your full Eclipse/NetBeans project with all source code in a zip named
after your student number as per the package naming above. This compressed folder
should be submitted to Moodle.

Notes
* Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
* In any situation, the lecturer is entitled to call you in for further explanation of your code.
Feed:
A Feed should have the following properties:
* An ArrayList that will hold all FeedItems.
* Methods implemented as per interface definition.
Feed Factory:
A FeedFactory should have:
* Methods implemented as per interface definition.

Solution with 3 approaches:
* Recursive binary search
* Map
* Stream
